Short term (and therefore relatively simple):

-) comedi_data_read -> non-reference single ended.
-) substitute Euler with exact solution in LIFNeuron::evolve.
-) understand why EnqueueEvent cannot be found.
-) add name in Entity? (also for data logging...)
-) fix shuffle function in randlib

Long term (and therefore possibly complicated):

-) Distinguish between entities and recorders (remember an OUconductance connected to both a neuron and a recorder) ?
-) OpenGL visualizer for recorded data.

Random thoughts:
Modify the random library to have one base class for UniformRandom and two subclasses for software and hardware implementationstruct. Moreover, there shouldn't be two distinct classes for SW and HW normal and poisson random numbers, but rather a single class which uses either a SW or a HW uniform random number generator.

>> Use a buffer also for the SW implementation of random number generators (i.e., in UniformRandom) ? <<
