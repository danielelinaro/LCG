=== Short term (and therefore relatively simple) ===

-) CHECK FOR MEMORY LEAKS (in H5Recorder??) !!!
-) see whether OU*, TimeLogger and Delay can be removed.
-) finish to add the ionic currents for LTS neurons.
-) set output limits equal to output range in comedi_io.

=== Long term (and therefore possibly complicated) ===

-) Distinguish between entities and recorders (remember an OUconductance connected to both a neuron and a recorder) ?
-) OpenGL visualizer for recorded data.

Random thoughts:
Modify the random library to have one base class for UniformRandom and two subclasses for software and hardware implementationstruct. Moreover, there shouldn't be two distinct classes for SW and HW normal and poisson random numbers, but rather a single class which uses either a SW or a HW uniform random number generator.

>> Use a buffer also for the SW implementation of random number generators (i.e., in UniformRandom) ? <<
