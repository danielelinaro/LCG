=== Short term (and therefore relatively simple) ===

-) control output trimming in comedi_io.cpp
-) remove useless scripts!
-) analog output should also be proxied in asynchronous mode.
-) add a Logger object.
-) see whether OU*, TimeLogger and Delay can be removed.
-) finish to add the ionic currents for LTS neurons.
-) Add warning in the documentation that IzhikevichNeuron emits spikes in the spike peak or change it to include a spike threshold.

=== Long term (and therefore possibly complicated) ===

-) Distinguish between entities and recorders (remember an OUconductance connected to both a neuron and a recorder) ?
-) OpenGL visualizer for recorded data.

Random thoughts:
Modify the random library to have one base class for UniformRandom and two subclasses for software and hardware implementationstruct. Moreover, there shouldn't be two distinct classes for SW and HW normal and poisson random numbers, but rather a single class which uses either a SW or a HW uniform random number generator.

>> Use a buffer also for the SW implementation of random number generators (i.e., in UniformRandom) ? <<

>> Allow AnalogOutput and AnalogInput objects to be executed only at half the realtime sampling rate (e.g. acquiring 2 samples every time and stepping half the times).
