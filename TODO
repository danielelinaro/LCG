=== Short term (and therefore relatively simple) ===

-) add a weight to handleEvent, that can be used for example by Connection.
-) add the possibility to specify the verbosity level at the command line.
-) add the ionic currents for LTS neurons.
-) set output limits equal to output range in comedi_io.
-) add the possibility to specify spike latency in PeriodicPulse.
-) add a timestamp in H5 files.
-) when <connections></connections> is in the cfg file, entity tries to connect to self.
-) use signals to catch SIGINT and terminate entities when <ctr>c is pressed.
-) Recorder can not write when the filename of a waveform does not exist (and one did not specify specific folder) and crashes dynclamp. 

=== Long term (and therefore possibly complicated) ===

-) Distinguish between entities and recorders (remember an OUconductance connected to both a neuron and a recorder) ?
-) OpenGL visualizer for recorded data.

Random thoughts:
Modify the random library to have one base class for UniformRandom and two subclasses for software and hardware implementationstruct. Moreover, there shouldn't be two distinct classes for SW and HW normal and poisson random numbers, but rather a single class which uses either a SW or a HW uniform random number generator.

>> Use a buffer also for the SW implementation of random number generators (i.e., in UniformRandom) ? <<
