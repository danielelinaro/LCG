## LCG documentation
The manual that describes the full capabilities and rationale behind LCG
can be found [here](lcg_manual.pdf). Please note that this is a current
work in progress and therefore several sections are still missing. The manual
will be updated as we add content to it: for the moment, please feel free to
contact [Daniele Linaro](mailto:danielelinaro@gmail.com) for any doubt you might have 
regarding the installation and the operation of LCG.

LCG uses stimulus files to describe arbitrary waveforms: such stimulus files
use a meta-description called STIMGEN format, whose syntax, together with
several examples, is described in [this manual](stimgen_manual.pdf).
