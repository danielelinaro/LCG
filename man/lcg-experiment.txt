lcg-experiment(1)
=================

NAME
----
lcg-experiment - Perform a voltage, current or dynamic clamp experiment described in an XML configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'lcg experiment' [-h | --help] [-v | --version] [-V | --verbosity]
	       [-i | --iti <seconds>] [-n | --ntrials <num>]
	       [-r | --disable-replay]
	       [-c | --config-file <xml file>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'lcg-experiment' is the main program contained in the LCG suite. Its purpose is to parse a
configuration file and instantiate and interconnect the objects that
are described in it. The configuration file should also contain an indication of the duration
of the experiment and the value of the sampling rate: given this information, 'lcg-experiment'
can run the experiment. The real-time capabilities are used only if the objects in the
configuration file are entities, since streams do not require real-time operation. See the man
page for 'entities' and 'streams' for more information about the differences between them.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
--help::
        Print a help message.

-v::
--version::
        Print the LCG suite version that the 'lcg-experiment' program came from.

-V::
--verbosity::
	Set the verbosity level of the program. Accepted values range from 0 (maximum verbosity)
	to 4 (minimum verbosity). The default level is 2.

-i <seconds>::
--iti <seconds>::
	Specify the inter-trial interval, i.e. the time the program will wait between trials.
	This option is meaningful only if the number of trials is greater than 1.

-n <num>::
--ntrials::
	Specify the number of trials, i.e. the repetitions of the same protocol that the program
	will run. The default value is 1.

-r::
--disable-replay::
	Instruct 'lcg-experiment' to not save additional metadata in the directory .lcg.

-c <file>::
--config-file <file>::
	Specify the configuration file to be used.

EXAMPLES
--------
The following command can be used to run 'lcg-experiment' 10 times, with an inter-trial interval
of 5 seconds, using the configuration file called stim.xml.

   $ lcg experiment -n 10 -i 5 -c stim.xml
