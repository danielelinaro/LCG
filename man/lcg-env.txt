LCG environment(7)
==================

NAME
----
lcg-env - Definition of LCG environment variables

DESCRIPTION
-----------
LCG uses a number of environment variables, described in the following. The distribution
of LCG contains a file, 'lcg-env.sh', that contains default values for these variables.
Such file should be copied in the home directory of the user, as explained in the Examples
section, and tailored to his/her needs.

VARIABLES
---------

COMEDI_DEVICE::
	The path to the device file from which data is read.

AI_CONVERSION_FACTOR_CC::
        The conversion factor to be used for the analog input, in current clamp mode.

AO_CONVERSION_FACTOR_CC::
        The conversion factor to be used for the analog output, in current clamp mode.

AI_CONVERSION_FACTOR_VC::
        The conversion factor to be used for the analog input, in voltage clamp mode.

AO_CONVERSION_FACTOR_VC::
        The conversion factor to be used for the analog output, in current clamp mode.

RANGE::
        The range of the output to the analog card.

AI_SUBDEVICE::
        The analog input subdevice on the acquisition card.

AI_CHANNEL::
        The default channel used for analog input.

AO_SUBDEVICE::
        The analog output subdevice on the acquisition card.

AO_CHANNEL::
        The default channel used for analog output.

AI_UNITS_CC::
        The units for the analog input, in current clamp mode.

AO_UNITS_CC::
        The units for the analog output, in current clamp mode.

AI_UNITS_VC::
        The units for the analog input, in voltage clamp mode.

AO_UNITS_VC::
        The units for the analog output, in voltage clamp mode.

SAMPLING_RATE::
        The default sampling rate of the acquisition.

GROUND_REFERENCE::
        The ground reference of the acquisition card. At present,
        Ground-Referenced Single Ended (GRSE) and Non-Referenced
        Single Ended (NRSE) are supported.

LCG_REALTIME::
        Whether to use real-time capabilities also when performing
        conventional voltage- and current-clamp experiments. If the
        system has a real-time kernel, then the default value of this
        variable is "yes", otherwise it is "no".

EXAMPLES
--------
The following example shows how to copy the default lcg-env.sh file that comes with
the distribution of LCG to the user's home directory and how to source it.

   $ cp lcg-env.sh $HOME/.lcg-env.sh
   $ source $HOME/.lcg-env.sh

The last line of the previous example should be added to a file that is read every time
the user logs in: typedefhis is usually $HOME/.bashrc on Linux systems or $HOME/.profile on OS X
systems.
