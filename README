Very important note: THE ORDER IN WHICH ENTITIES ARE CONNECTED MATTERS !!!

This is because the OUconductance entity assumes that the first
''post'' object is a neuron, and therefore uses its output (the
membrane voltage) to compute the actual current.

The current solution to this is to first connect all entities - except
recorders - among themselves and then connect the entities to the recorders.

See bin/noisy_bg.cpp for an example.
