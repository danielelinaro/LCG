Of course, if \progname were restricted only to the protocols
described in Chapter~\ref{chap:protocols}, it would constitute a
cheap replacement of commercial programs such as Pulse, which offer a
vast array of additional functionalities. What makes \progname
extremely powerful and \emph{versatile} is the possibility to define
arbitrary \emph{stimulus} files to be used in voltage and current
clamp experiments, described in this chapter, and the possibility to
use \emph{configuration} files to describe arbitrary experiments,
(e.g., dynamic clamp or closed loop experiments) defined as the
interactions of elementary objects. Configuration files and such
objects, called \emph{entities} in the context pf \progname, are
described in detail in Chapters~\ref{chap:configuration} and
\ref{chap:entities}, respectively. This chapter describes how to use
\progname to inject arbitrary waveforms, described in stimulus files.

In principle, all traditional electrophysiology protocols (i.e., those
that do not require real-time control over the recorded quantities),
can be implemented in \progname by using just two commands,
\verb+lcg-stimgen+ and \verb+lcg-stimulus+: the former produces
stim-files\footnote{The syntax of stim-files is explained in great
  detail in the companion manual, which must be read to properly
  understand the following instructions.} according to the
specification of the user, and the
latter applies the synthesized waveforms to the appropriate output
channels while at the same time recording from an arbitrary number of
input channels. 

As a matter of fact, all the protocols described in
Chapter~\ref{chap:protocols}, with the exception of f-I
curve and frequency clamp protocols described in Sections~\ref{sec:fi}
and \ref{sec:fclamp}, respectively, can be implemented using only
\verb+lcg-stimgen+ and \verb+lcg-stimulus+. The reason for their
existence is simply the possibility to define appropriate default
values, which make the application of the protocols even simpler.

We will first briefly summarize the rationale behind the meta-language
used to generate stimulation files and then describe how to generate
them using \verb+lcg-stimgen+ and how to use \verb+lcg-stimulus+ to
stimulate and record using stimulation files.

\section{Stimulation files}
Stimulation files, or in short \textit{stim-files}, are simply text
files that contain a piecewise description of a particular
waveform. More in detail, each stim-file is composed of a certain
number of lines, with each line representing an elementary
sub-waveform: the full waveform is therefore given by the
concatenation of all sub-waveforms. Each elementary sub-waveform is
described by 12 coefficients:
\begin{table}[h!!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccccccccccc}
$T$ & code & $p_1$ & $p_2$ & $p_3$ & $p_4$ & $p_5$ & fix-seed & seed &
subcode & op & exp
\end{tabular}
%\caption{Coefficients required for the definition of a sub-waveform.}
\label{tab:subwav}
\end{table}

The meaning of the coefficients is the following:
\begin{table}[h!!]
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
$T$ & duration of the sub-waveform \\
code & code that identifies the sub-waveform \\
$p_1, \ldots, p_5$ & parameters that specify the sub-waveform \\
fix-seed & whether or not the seed should be fixed (only for
stochastic sub-waveforms) \\
seed & the seed to use (only for stochastic sub-waveforms) \\
subcode & the code of another sub-waveform, if algebraic operations
are to be performed \\
op & the algebraic operation to perform \\
exp & the exponent to which the sub-waveform should be raised
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:params}
\end{table}

Available codes range from 1 to 12 and identify 12 different types of
elementary sub-waveforms, such as constants, sinusoids, square waves,
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process realizations, and so on. The
full list of available waveforms is described in detailed in the
companion manual, which can be found at
\url{http://danielelinaro.github.io/dynclamp/stimgen_manual.pdf}.

If a noisy waveform is to be used, it is possible to set the seed used
in the generation of the pseudo-random numbers. It is also possible to
specify whether the seed should be used or not: in the latter case, a
random seed is generated using the device \verb+/dev/random+,
available on most UNIX systems.

As mentioned previously, sub-waveforms can be combined to yield more
complex stimulation waveforms: this is not limited only to the
concatenation of elementary sub-waveforms, but can be implemented also
by applying algebraic operations to sets of sub-waveforms. The way
this is achieved is described in the companion manual.

Finally, each elementary sub-waveform can be raised to a particular
exponent (for example 0.5 to obtain the square root of a waveform):
this is achieved by setting the appropriate value for the last
parameter of the sub-waveform.

This description of stimulus files is by no means exhaustive: we
strongly encourage readers to familiarize themselves with the
definition of stimulation waveforms by reading carefully through the
companion manual.

\section{Generating stimulation files}
As mentioned previously, stimulation files can be generated in
\progname using the command \verb+lcg-stimgen+: this provides a
convenient interface to the stim-file language, and saves the user the
hassle of having to write stim-files manually. Also, it provides a way
of interacting directly with \verb+lcg-stimulus+ by feeding the output
of \verb+lcg-stimgen+ to \verb+lcg-stimulus+ by means of UNIX pipes,
as will be described in the following section.

The syntax of \verb+lcg-stimgen+ is the following:
\begin{verbatim}
lcg-stimgen -o|--output filename [-a|--append] 
          <waveform_1> [option <value>] p_1 p_2 ... p_5
          <waveform_2> [option <value>] p_1 p_2 ... p_5
          ...
          <waveform_N> [option <value>] p_1 p_2 ... p_5
\end{verbatim}
Since \verb+lcg-stimgen+ can deal with an arbitrary number of
waveforms, the options that specify the output file name (\verb+-o+ or
\verb+--output+ switches) and whether the output should be appended to
an existing file (\verb+-a+ or \verb+--append+ switches) should
precede the definition of any sub-waveform. If no output file is
specified, \verb+lcg-stimgen+ will output the resulting stim-file to
standard output: this is useful both for testing purposes and for
usage in conjuction with \verb+lcg-stimulus+ as will be described in
the following.

Next comes the specification of each single sub-waveform with its
parameters: the first parameter (i.e, \verb+waveform_1+,
\verb+waveform_2+ and so on) is a code that represent the type of
waveform. At present, the accepted codes are \verb+dc+, \verb+ou+,
\verb+sine+, \verb+square+, \verb+saw+, \verb+chirp+, \verb+ramp+,
\verb+poisson-reg+, \verb+poisson-exp+, \verb+poisson-bi+,
\verb+gaussian+, \verb+alpha+. For the meaning of each one, see the
companion manual. The optional arguments for each sub-waveform are the
following:
\begin{table}[h!!]
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
-d & duration of the sub-waveform in seconds \\
-s & seed of the sub-waveform, also sets \verb+fix-seed+ accordingly \\
-e & exponent of the sub-waveform \\
-p & sum this sub-waveform and the following \\
-m & subtract the following sub-waveform from this one \\
-M & multiply this sub-waveform and the following \\
-D & divide this sub-waveform by the following \\
-E & compute the composite waveform: this option is required for the last waveform in a series
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:optargs}
\end{table}
\newline
Every short option has a corresponding long one, detailed in the
online help of \verb+lcg-stimgen+, accessible by issuing at a prompt the
following command:
\begin{lstlisting}
lcg-stimgen -h
\end{lstlisting}
Additionally, all other options ---except for the duration--- have default
values, which are also detailed in the online help of the command.

The positional arguments \verb+p_1+ to \verb+p_5+ come after the
optional arguments. Each waveform requires a certain number of
parameters: for instance, the constant waveform requires just one
parameter, whereas a sinusoidal waveform requires 4. The exact number
of parameters required by each sub-waveform is accessible by issuing
the command
\begin{lstlisting}
lcg-stimgen help <code>
\end{lstlisting}
where code is one of the sub-waveform codes described before: for
example, the command
\begin{lstlisting}
lcg-stimgen help sine
\end{lstlisting}
produces the following output:
\begin{verbatim}
Waveform `sine' takes 4 parameters:
   1) amplitude
   2) frequency (Hz)
   3) phase
   4) offset
\end{verbatim}
