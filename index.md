LCG is a software suite for electrophysiological experiments.

It offers functionalities for performing not only standard current and
voltage clamp experiments, but also dynamic clamp and closed loop
experiments. Additionally, LCG makes it easy to perform hybrid
experiments, in which real and simulated elements are seamlessly
integrated.

### Features
The main features of LCG are the following:
- dynamic clamp capabilities, with built-in active electrode compensation; 
- straightforward design and implementation of closed loop and hybrid experiments; 
- command-line operability; 
- ease of automation by scripting; 
- compact description of stimulation waveforms; 
- simple implementation of non real time protocols (e.g., current and voltage clamp); 
- support for multiple real time engines; 
- simple installation and operation procedures. 

### Installation
Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](installation.html).

### Documentation
Extensive documentation on the usage of LCG can be found [here](manual.html).

### Authors and Contributors
LCG is mostly written and maintained by [Daniele Linaro](mailto:danielelinaro@gmail.com).
[Jo√£o Couto](mailto:jpcouto@gmail.com) contributed code and design ideas, while [Michele
Giugliano](mailto:michele.giugliano@ua.ac.be) wrote the STIMGEN library used to generate arbitrary stimuli.
