LCG is a software to perform electrophysiological experiments.

It offers functionalities for performing not only standard current- and voltage-clamp
experiments, but also dynamic-clamp and closed-loop experiments. Additionally, LCG makes
it easy to perform hybrid experiments, in which real and simulated elements are seamlessly
integrated.
