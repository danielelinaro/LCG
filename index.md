LCG is a software to perform electrophysiological experiments.

It offers functionalities for performing not only standard current- and voltage-clamp
experiments, but also dynamic-clamp and closed-loop experiments. Additionally, LCG makes
it easy to perform hybrid experiments, in which real and simulated elements are seamlessly
integrated.

### Features

### Installation
Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](installation.html).

### Documentation
An extensive documentation of the STIMGEN format is available [here](stimgen_doc.pdf).

### Authors and Contributors
LCG is mostly written and maintained by [Daniele Linaro](mailto:danielelinaro@gmail.com).
[Jo√£o Couto](mailto:jpcouto@gmail.com) contributed code and design ideas, while [Michele
